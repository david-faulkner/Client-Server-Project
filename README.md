# Client-Server-Project
 
This is a simple client-server interaction program. The server can accomodate multiple clients
connecting at the same time using different threads. A user can login, logout, quit,
retrieve a message of the day, store a message of the day, send a private message to someone
else who is logged in, obtain a list of those logged in, and shutdown the server. The messages
of the day are read from an input file and any new messages added will be stored in the
file upon shutdown of the server. This program was tested to work on the University
of Michigan-Dearborn Unix servers.
