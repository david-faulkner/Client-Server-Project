Let us make our future now, and let us make our dreams tomorrows reality
The world is full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper
It is always the simple that produces the marvelous
Keep your face always toward the sunshine and shadows will fall behind you
All you need is the plan, the road map, and the courage to press on to your destination
